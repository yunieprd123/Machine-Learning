Excited to share my recent work in Digital Skill Fair 33.0 by dibimbing.id!
This portfolio highlights the classification of iris flower species using machine learning. Here's a brief overview:

Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Explored features like petal and sepal measurements to identify patterns in the Iris dataset.
Model Development: Trained and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier to achieve perfect accuracy of 1.0 (100%).
Performance Evaluation: Detailed analysis using metrics like precision, recall, and a confusion matrix confirmed the model's reliability.
I'm using The dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/131GwonPpff3FLVmBO7XI8hCqtvoxYcDJ?usp=sharing

A heartfelt thanks to my mentors at dibimbing.id for their guidance throughout this project!
